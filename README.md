# Library Management Backend

This project provides a backend system for managing library operations, including user authentication, book issuance, and librarian functionalities.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign-up, sign-in, and secure user authentication.
- **Book Management**: Add, update, delete, and view books.
- **User Requests**: Users can request books, and librarians can issue them if available.
- **Librarian Controls**: Manage book inventory and issue requested books.

## System Design Overview

The system is designed with the following components:

### Schemas

1. **User Schema**:
   - `name`
   - `registrationId`
   - `email`
   - `password`
   - `booksIssued` (list of books)
   - `issuedDate`

2. **Librarian Schema**:
   - `name`
   - `registrationId`
   - `email`
   - `password`

3. **Book Schema**:
   - `title`
   - `author`
   - `count`
   - `id`

### Flow Diagram

1. **Authentication**:
   - Users and librarians must sign up and sign in to access the system.
   - Secure authentication processes.

2. **User Requests**:
   - Users can request books they want to borrow.
   - Requests are handled by librarians.

3. **Librarian Actions**:
   - Issue books if available.
   - Add, update, or delete book records.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine.
- **Database**: A database like MongoDB to store schema data.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kishu279/Librariian-Management-Backend.git
   cd Librariian-Management-Backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following:
     ```env
     PORT=3000
     DATABASE_URL=<your-database-url>
     JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-key>
     ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
